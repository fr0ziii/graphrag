# GraphRAG Ontology Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file defines the knowledge graph schema for the ingestion pipeline.
# Change this file to adapt to any domain WITHOUT modifying Python code.
#
# To switch domains (e.g., from Renewable Energy to Medicine):
#   1. Update the entity_types, relation_types, and validation_schema
#   2. Re-run the ingestion: uv run python -m src.ingestion
# =============================================================================

# Human-readable domain name (for logging and documentation)
domain: "Renewable Energy"

# Schema version for tracking changes
version: "1.0"

# =============================================================================
# Entity Types
# =============================================================================
# These define the types of nodes that can exist in the knowledge graph.
# Use UPPERCASE by convention for consistency with Neo4j labels.
entity_types:
  - TECHNOLOGY
  - CONCEPT
  - LOCATION
  - METRIC
  - ORGANIZATION
  - MATERIAL

# =============================================================================
# Relation Types
# =============================================================================
# These define the types of edges (relationships) between nodes.
# Use UPPERCASE with underscores by convention.
relation_types:
  - USES
  - PRODUCES
  - LOCATED_IN
  - AFFECTS
  - HAS_METRIC
  - DEVELOPED_BY

# =============================================================================
# Validation Schema
# =============================================================================
# Maps each entity type to its allowed outgoing relationships.
# This constrains which triplets are valid during extraction.
#
# Example: TECHNOLOGY can have outgoing edges of type USES, PRODUCES, etc.
#          but LOCATION can only have LOCATED_IN (typically as a target).
#
# Triplets not conforming to this schema will be rejected when strict=True.
